            CedarGlide Wax began with a simple mission: create wax that performs
            as hard as the riders who use it. For over three decades, we‚Äôve been
            handcrafting formulas designed to handle real mountain
            conditions‚Äîfrom frozen powder mornings to slushy spring laps.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started in a garage with a hot iron and a passion for perfect
            turns has grown into a trusted name on the slopes. Our roots are
            deep in the snowboarding culture, shaped by late-night tuning
            sessions, local competitions, and countless chairlift conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We‚Äôve tested our wax across continents and climates‚Äîbut our heart
            has always stayed close to home: where the snow is unpredictable,
            the stoke is real, and the ride matters most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the years, one thing‚Äôs never changed: our commitment to{" "}
